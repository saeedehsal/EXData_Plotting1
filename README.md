Exploratory data analysis week1 project

It basically inlcludes 4 png files and 4 seperate scripts to generate each.

In order to be able to generate each of the graphs you need to:


1- download my scripts to the same directory that you have put the data in
2- download data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
3- copy paste the txt file that has been downloaded to your main R directory
4- Run the scripts
